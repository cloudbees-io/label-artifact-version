== Usage examples

The following basic example adds the labels `For Production` and `Testing Passed` to an existing artifact version:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
    add_labels_to_artifact_version:
        steps:
          - name: add_labels_to_artifact_version
            uses: cloudbees-io/label-artifact-version@v1
            with:
              artifact-id: 1234abcd-56ef-78ab-90cd-ef123412abcd
              labels: For Production,Testing Passed

----

In the following example, an artifact version has been labelled with `Label1`, `Label2`, and `Label3`.
Invoking this action removes the `Label2` and `Label3` labels, so that the artifact version remains labelled only with `Label1`.

[source,yaml]
----
        steps:
        - name: Unlabel an artifact version
          uses: cloudbees-io/label-artifact-version@v1
          with:
            artifact-id: 1234abcd-56ef-78ab-90cd-ef123412abcd
            labels: Label2,Label3
            operation: REMOVE
